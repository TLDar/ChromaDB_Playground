# ChromaDB Playground

## Project Overview

This project utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract key information from academic research papers. By combining document retrieval with a language model, it enables users to ask questions and receive accurate, context-aware answers based on the content of the papers.

## Content

This repository currently contains a set of Jupyter notebooks used for experimenting with various tools and technologies (ChromaDB, embeddings, RAG).

## Project Genesis

This project was inspired by the work of Thu Vu in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFUE4DHiAPM), but it was built entirely from scratch without cloning or copying any existing repository. The implementation, structure, and approach reflect my own understanding and learning goals.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12** â€“ Main programming language.
- **LangChain** â€“ Framework for building applications with language models.
- **Hugging Face Inference API** â€“ Access to pre-trained transformer models for natural language processing tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers (local)** â€“ Utilized locally to generate text embeddings by loading pre-trained models.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Interactive environment for developing and testing code.
- **ChromaDB** â€“ Open-source vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
