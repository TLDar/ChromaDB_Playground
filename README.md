# ChromaDB Playground

This project is mainly a playground for experimenting with ChromaDB and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

##  Content

This repository currently contains a set of Jupyter notebooks used for experimenting with various tools and technologies (ChromaDB, embeddings, etc.).

## Project Genesis

This project was inspired by the work of Thu Vu in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFUE4DHiAPM), but it was built entirely from scratch without cloning or copying any existing repository. The implementation, structure, and approach reflect my own understanding and learning goals.
